* Tracking of scores and progress.
* Unlockable items
* Simple in app purchase.
* Standard dialogs such as settings and game over.
* General dialog handling
* Advertising support
* ‘Free prize’ functionality
* ‘Social’ functionality
* Debugging and test functions
* Many helper classes and components from Animation through UI

The source code is open and free to use in your games under a license similar to other assets from the Unity Asset Store. If you make modification or improvements please submit them back for inclusion.

## Contribution

We appreciate all contributions. If you want to contribute then here are a few guidelines:

* If you want to add a feature, post an issue about it first. Some features are intentionally left out, others may already be in the works, or I may have some advice on how I think it should be done.
* If you want to do a bug fix, it might not be a bad idea to post about it too. I've had the same bug fixed by multiple people at the same time before.
* Pull requests should have a single commit. If you have multiple commits, squash them into a single commit before requesting a pull.
* Try and follow the code styling already in place.

The basic principles of contributing using github are:
* Fork the codebase
* Create a branch
* Commit your changes
* Push to the branch
* Open a pull request.

If you have any questions or queries then please contact via http://www.flipwebapps.com/contact/
